# Mr.Dev.'s Widget
Mr.Dev. is your provider of developing tools!

He brings you a widget to display your categories and posts from Wordpress with many customizable layouts and options to choose from. 

##
### Themes & Layouts
The widget initially comes with the themes ‘None’ and ‘Default’.
'Default' has many layouts to choose from including a custom layout to choose each option. It's also possible to develop new custom themes. This is perfect if you already have a website and want to display your content in a new way, while keeping the look & feel of your current template.

### Additional information
Mr.Dev. starts with categories because some *content display plugins* and *CMS* do not highlight categories as much as posts/articles. But that could be practical for a better organization, structure, search engine optimization and a better understanding of the front and backoffice from clients and users.

##
### Compatibility Warning ⚠ 
If you need the widget to work properly with Internet Explorer, you'll need to use a [polyfill](https://polyfill.io/v3/) if you are not yet using one. On the full version (Mr.Dev.) you can activate the polyfill from the settings page of the plugin.
